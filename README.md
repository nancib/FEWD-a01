FEWD Assignment 1

## Introductions
Hello, my name is **Nanci**. I'm studying to become a front-end web developer. 

Here is a picture of one of my favorite animals. I actually love almost all animals, but I have allergies so I have to stay away from them. Yes, it's very sad. :(

I'm into new technologies, but not social media, so I don't have personal stuff to link to on the web. Anyway, I set up a new Twitter account:[ @nancib2020](https://www.twitter.com/nancib2020). I'll probably forget the password and it will be deactivated in 2-3 months. No biggie.

## FEWD
 _**FEWD**_(Front End Web Development) is a free, two-semester program offered at **San Diego Continuing Education**. We are studying:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* and much more.

I find the topics interesting and challenging. _Fun stuff!_ I hope to find a job in the industry soon, but I still have a lot to learn so I haven't even updated my resume. I've found it difficult to find reputable training resources that don't cost an arm and a leg. That's part of the reason I enrolled in SDCE's FEWD program. The instructors here are well-qualified and the material is on point, so I'm very grateful to be here.  

I've set up a website, but I don't have anything worth looking at yet. I set pretty high standards for myself, so it's embarrassing to publish mediocre work. I will eventually post a portfolio there, but I'm busy right now and that can wait until I've completed some better quality work.

Regards,
Nanci

P.S. Zak showed us how to integrate our GitHub account into Visual Studio Code, so I completed that step on my laptop and am updating the file here. Hopefully, you will see this message in my repo if I did everything correctly.
